# Chapel configuration scripts

This directory contains some predefined Chapel configuration scripts targeting
the following systems:
- laptop (Linux);
- the [Aion](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/aion/) supercomputer;
- the [MeluXina](https://docs.lxp.lu/) supercomputer.

For each of these systems, we provide both multicore (single-locale) and distributed (multi-locale) configurations. By default, each script is expected to download,
configure and build the latest version of Chapel.
