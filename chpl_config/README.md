# Chapel configuration scripts

This directory contains some predefined Chapel configuration scripts targeting the following systems:
- laptop (Linux);
- the [Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Home) testbed;
- the [Aion](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/aion/) supercomputer;
- the [Irene](https://docs.lxp.lu/) supercomputer (unstable);
- the [MeluXina](https://docs.lxp.lu/) supercomputer (unstable).

For each of these systems, we provide both multicore (single-locale) and distributed (multi-locale) configurations. By default, each script is expected to download, configure and build the latest version of Chapel.
